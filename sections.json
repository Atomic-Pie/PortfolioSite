We split tasks among the team, with some members working on building a prototype interface while others concentrated on preparing the presentation materials. We developed a working prototype that showcased the core features of the Warfarin Patient App, including real-time tracking, notifications, and an easy-to-use interface. Additionally, we created a detailed poster that visually explained our solution, from the problem statement and research insights to the proposed features and benefits. After hours of polishing both the prototype and the presentation, we presented our solution to a panel of judges, explaining how it directly addresses the needs of patients and healthcare providers. The judges were impressed with our clear, patient-centric approach and the potential impact of the solution."

            "description": "I am a Junior Full Stack Developer with a passion for exploring complex logic systems and solving challenging problems. My journey into programming began with automating tasks in games using AutoHotKey (AHK), which naturally led to a self-taught progression into Python, JavaScript, and other programming languages. Since then, Iâ€™ve honed my skills both through formal education and personal projects.<br><br>I hold a BSc (Honours) in Information Technology from Technological University Dublin, where I specialized in software development. During my studies, I gained hands-on experience with technologies like JavaScript, Python, C#, SQL, and ASP.NET MVC. Iâ€™m particularly comfortable with front-end development using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and React, but Iâ€™m now transitioning into full-stack development with a growing interest in back-end technologies like Node.js and SQL.<br><br>My technical background is complemented by real-world experience, including a role as a Tier 2 Integration Support at Expedia, where I worked on troubleshooting and resolving integration issues. I also completed an internship at the Department of Social Protection, contributing to the development and testing of features for the MyWelfare and MyGovID platforms. In this role, I improved the user experience by implementing accessibility features and writing automated unit tests to ensure system reliability. Outside of formal work, I love building side projects and experimenting with new technologies.<br><br>What drives me is the opportunity to combine creativity with problem-solving, and I thrive when exploring interesting, non-standard approaches to technical challenges. If you're looking for a developer who is adaptable, curious, and committed to building efficient, creative solutions, I'd love to connect and explore opportunities to collaborate."
